## Blocitoff: This is your fairly standard To-Do List application, but with a twist! All tasks are self-destructing.

Blocitoff will aim to keep to-do lists manageable by automatically deleting to-do items that have not been completed after seven days. The hypothesis is that if the to-do item is not important enough to be completed in seven days, it doesn't belong on your to-do list.

Made with my mentor, Adam, at [Bloc](http://bloc.io)
